# MIPS-Assembly
##Collection of my programs in Assembly Language. 

  I have just started learning MIPS Assembly Language. 
  I will add more codes as I learn.

##How to run assembly language??

  - Downloads MARS simulator from :- ```http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm```
  
  - In a DOS Shell or Ubuntu Terminal :-```Use command "java -jar mars.jar"(without quotes) (Here mars.jar is name of downlaoded file)```
  - Requirements to run jar file :- ```Java J2SE 1.5 (or later) SDK installed on your computer.```
  
  - Open MARS simulator.
  
  - Create a new file and write some MIPS code into it. You can use one of my codes to get a feel. 
 
  - Save the file.  

  - Go to Run option in menu bar.
  
  - First Click on Assemble. 
  
  - If assemble is successful
   
  - Click on Go.
